Shell scritp for updating NextCloud

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
# ALWAYS MAKE BACKUPS!!!

# Howto

- Download the shell script in the folder above the nextcloud installation.
- Run it either with a specified version `./update.sh 31.2.0`
- Or run without any version `./update.sh` - in this case it will just do some maintenance tasks.
